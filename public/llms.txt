# Snake AI Arena

> A 3D Snake game where users write AI algorithms to compete on a global leaderboard.

## Overview

Snake AI Arena is an interactive platform for learning and experimenting with AI pathfinding algorithms. Players can write JavaScript code to control a snake, benchmark their algorithms, and compete against others.

## Main Features

- **AI Editor**: Write custom JavaScript algorithms to control the snake
- **Live Preview**: Watch your algorithm play in real-time 3D visualization
- **Benchmarking**: Run your algorithm through multiple games to get average scores
- **Leaderboard**: Compete globally with other players' algorithms
- **Manual Play**: Play the classic snake game with keyboard or touch controls

## Algorithm API

Algorithms receive a game state object and must return a direction:

```javascript
function decideDirection(gameState) {
  // gameState contains:
  // - head: {x, y, z} - snake head position
  // - food: {x, y, z} - food position
  // - body: [{x, y, z}, ...] - snake body segments
  // - direction: current direction vector
  // - gridSize: size of the game grid

  // Return: 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right', 'forward', or 'backward'
  return 'up';
}
```
